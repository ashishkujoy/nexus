Context:

You are working on Story 5: Split Monolithic API Route from the Nexus Performance Improvement Stories. We've successfully migrated 2 APIs and created utility functions. The project builds successfully and all refactored APIs are working.

Current Status:

Completed APIs:
/api/batches/route.ts - Batch creation (POST)
/api/batches/[batchId]/interns/route.ts - Intern onboarding (POST)
/api/batches/[batchId]/observations/route.ts - Observations (POST - always expects array of observations)
/api/batches/[batchId]/feedbacks/route.ts - Feedback creation (POST)
/api/feedbacks/[feedbackId]/deliver/route.ts - Feedback delivery (POST)
/api/feedbacks/[feedbackId]/conversation/route.ts - Feedback conversation (GET)
/api/batches/[batchId]/interns/[internId]/route.ts - Individual intern operations (PATCH - update fields, DELETE - terminate)

Created Utilities:
/src/app/lib/api-utils.ts - Common validation and response functions

Remaining API's
1. All APIs have been successfully migrated! ðŸŽ‰

Step by Step process to follow:
For each API migration
1. Create the new RESTful API route
    - Use the utility functions from /src/app/lib/api-utils.ts
    - Implement Zod validation schemas
    - Follow the established patterns from completed APIs
2. Update client-side code
    - Find where the old API is being called
    - Update to use the new RESTful endpoint
3. Clean up the monolithic API
4. Build and test

Important Notes
- Next.js 15: Use { params: Promise<{ batchId: string }> } and await params
- Zod Validation: Always create schemas for request validation
- Utility Functions: Use the established patterns from api-utils.ts
- Error Handling: Use ErrorResponses for consistent error messages
- Build Testing: Run npm run build after each API migration
- One at a time: Complete one API fully before moving to the next

ðŸŽ‰ MIGRATION COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

All APIs have been successfully migrated from the monolithic API to RESTful endpoints. The project now follows modern API design patterns with proper validation, error handling, and consistent structure.
